 <p>, Its been quite sometime that I have thought of writing some travel blogs out of curiosity but never found anything to write about. I got busy into my professional life, could not make time to plan. Previously I used to travel a lot with friends, family and even alone. But its been some years that I ran after making money.</p>   
 I am an avid lover of hills & always prefer mountains over beaches, but after researching on internet to choose the place, I thought this time why not plan for some non-preference one. Being born & brought up in Kolkata, when thinking of beaches, the first one comes in mind is ‘Digha’ then ‘Puri’. These are the most visited beaches in West Bengal & Orissa respectively. Then I thought to add some spices into my journey and zeroed down to visit the longest unbroken sea beach of the world “Cox’s Bazar’, Bangladesh. I should write this blog way before. Its actually not an informative travel blog, rather an experience sharing piece. Here I will more describe the beauty of Cox’s Bazar sea beach and adjacent areas. This is part of my Bangladesh travel experience. This journey will speak about Dhaka-Cox’s Bazar-Dhaka journey</p>

In 2018, I arranged a 3-days and 4-nights trip at Saint Martin island. I was influenced to make a trip there from an elder brother of my campus. He is a hodophile, just like me. Saint Martin is prohibited for tourist gatherings from April to September. We started to plan the budget for this trip from November 18 I hosted a public event on social media for the interested tourists to join with us and got a tremendous response. 55 People booked for the trip. Lastly, 40 people from different backgrounds, Mostly my fellow classmates, joined in.
 
    St. Martin's island, the only coral island in Bangladesh, located in the northeastern part of the Bay of Bengal, forming the southernmost part of Bangladesh. St. Martin's Island is located about 9 km south of Teknaf in Cox's Bazar district and 8 km west of the coast of Myanmar at the mouth of the Naf River. It is also locally known as Narikel Jinjira because of the abundance of coconuts. Many years ago, in unfavorable weather conditions, an Arabian merchant ship carrying Daru Chini(Cinnamon) crashed into a huge rock under the water, causing the cinnamon to spread throughout the island, later renamed St. Martin's Island as 'Cinnamon' Island.
